## Problem Statement
In the modern digital age, people spend a significant amount of time on social media platforms. While social media can be useful, excessive usage may reduce personal productivity. The problem is to analyse whether daily social media usage has an impact on productivity and to build a simple predictive model based on real-world data.

## Scope
- Use a public Kaggle dataset related to social media and productivity.
- Perform basic data cleaning and analysis using Python in Google Colab.
- Visualise important relationships using simple graphs.
- Train and evaluate a basic machine learning model (Linear Regression).

## Target Users
Students, employees and general users who are interested in understanding how their social media habits may affect their productivity.
